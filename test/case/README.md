# test/case

Represents test cases that test a particular feature, functionality, or bug. In a specific scenerio or assumption.

This may or may not represent typical user behaviour flows. And may make certain key assumptions.

For example it could involve using an API / admin panel call to setup some preconfigured scenerios, 
before testing a specific functionality.

Alternatively for bugs, it could be the least required steps to replicate a bug.
